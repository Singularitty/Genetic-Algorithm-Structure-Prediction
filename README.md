# Genetic-Algorithm-Structure-Prediction
An implementation of a genetic algorithm in Python for predicting equilibrium crystal structures for a given potential. The potential implemented here is the Daoud-Cotton model, but this can be easily changed.

Code is running, but there are some execptions that are raised and need to be fixed, and end results haven't been confirmed yet.
